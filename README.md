## Data Scientist
I have experience with programming languages python, matlab, C++ in applications related to Robotics, Artificial Vision and IoT. My interests are focused in artificial intelligence, robotics and academic research.

### Education
- B.S., Electronic Eng. | Universidad Privada Antenor Orrego (_July 2023_)

### Work Experience
**Research assistant @ Multidisciplinary Research Laboratory (_September 2021 - July 2023_)**
- Research latest techniques related to specific fields (deep learning, signal processing) and apply them to current robot projects.
- Implement and optimize DL-methods to achieve real time detection/segmentation.
- Implement signal processing methods (analog/digital).
- Writing final reports that are presented at each stage of the research projects.
- Present the research at international/national congress.

### Projects

**Development and implementation of a robotic system to carry out an efficient and continuous quality control on seedlings grown in Industrial Nurseries in La Libertad - Peru (_Match 2019 - June 2021_)**

- Design a software architecture to manage the different sources of information (cameras, seedling positions, deep learning predictions).
- Deploy the IoT platform based on NodeJS to manage the transplanting process of seedlings in a local and cloud environment.


**Robotic system for efficient and continuous quality control of the growth of industrial nursery seedlings in the La Libertad region of Peru (_March 2021 - August 2023_)**

- Learned and summarized the studies of object detection/segmentation and object tracking techniques with deep learning, also classification with convolutional networks.
- Implement techniques researched and compared to find the best one according to precision, inference time and computing resource consuming.
- Develop classification methods based on convolutional neural networks.
- Optimize the best one with tools such as TensorRT and deploy in a JetsonXavier hardware with ROS Noetic.

**Development and implementation of a Multifunctional Automated Machine for the Sowing of Seeds of Different Sizes in multi-cell trays and Pealing of Seedlings according to the quality of Growth in Nurseries of the La Libertad Region-Peru (_March 2023 - December 2023_)**

- Learned and summarized the studies of object detection/segmentation techniques with deep learning, also classification methods based on self-supervised learning (autoencoders).
- Develop a classification method to categorize seedlings in good or not-good based on a criteria developed by experts in agroindustrial farms.
- Implement techniques and compare to find the best one according to precision, inference time and computing resource consuming.
